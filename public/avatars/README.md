# Avatar Images

This folder should contain profile avatar images for the dashboard.

## Required Images

For the profile dropdown to work correctly, you need to have the following file:

- `01.png` - Used as the default profile image

You can add any avatar image here (JPG or PNG format) and use them throughout the application.

## Naming Convention

Avatar files should be named sequentially with numbers:

- `01.png`
- `02.png`
- etc.

Or use meaningful names like:

- `sarah.png`
- `john.png`
